# 2024-Atlanta-Science-and-Technology-Fair-Demo

This was the project that I presented to approximately 4000 people for the 2024 Atlanta Science and Technology Fair hosted by Georgia Institute of Technology. The purpose of this project is to utilize Machine Learning to track all the points of someones body. These include, but are not limited to, nose, shoulders, hips, knees, and thumbs. All these points are then used to predict a pixel on the window using Machine Learning that represents the person's full body. As the person moves, so does the point. Later on, this point will be a Bee. This way a person's body movements will control the Bee Game Character's movements in Electronic Artrium Exhibit: https://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/vxe. This exhibit is set to open in Spring of 2025.

In the Learning folder, you will see the files I made while learning how to create Machine Learning models using XGBoost library.
In the Demo folder, you will see all the necessary files needed to produce the demo I hosted for this event as well as the demo file itself.
